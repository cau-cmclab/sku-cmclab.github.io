        <p class="cmc-container-project-para">In this paper introduces the color estimation technique of illumination in outdoor augmented reality. In outdoor augmented reality, there is a color difference between outdoor illumination and virtual illumination applied to an augmented object, the user who uses the augmented reality can be inconvenient. Therefore, defining the color channel values through analysis of outdoor illumination colors, the defined values were applied to virtual illumination. The application of the defined values will reduce the difference between the illuminations, thus eliminating the user's discomfort. In addition, applying the weather implemented by virtual objects together with the color estimation technique, we cope flexibly with weather changes occurring in outdoor augmented reality. This action improves the visual coincidence between the outdoor background and the augmented object. </p>
